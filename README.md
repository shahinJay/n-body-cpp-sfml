# N-Body Sim (C++/SFML)

> **Transitioning a custom physics engine from CLI to 2D Graphics.**

---

### Goals
- [x] **Logic Prototype:** Functional 1D console sim with gravity classes.
- [ ] **2D Rendering:** Migrating to SFML for real-time visualization.
- [ ] **Optimization:** Optimizing to handle a reasonably large number of particles.

### Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++20 (Core Logic)
* **Graphics:** SFML (Rendering & Windowing)
* **Physics:** Numerical Integration (Euler/Verlet)

---

### The Vision
I am moving away from high-level engines like **Godot** to understand the "essence" of physics simulations at the hardware level. This project focuses on building a custom engine from scratch, handling everything from vector math to memory-efficient rendering.
