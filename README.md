##N-Body Sim (C++/SFML)

#Transitioning a custom physics engine from CLI to 2D Graphics

#Goals:
  [x] Logic Prototype: Functional 1D console sim with gravity classes.
  [ ] 2D Rendering: Migrating to SFML for real-time visualization.
  [ ] Optimization: optimizing to handle a reasonably large number of particles.

#Tech:
1. C++20 (Core Logic)
2. SFML (Rendering & Windowing)
3. Numerical Integration (Euler/Verlet)
